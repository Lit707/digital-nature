<h2>Colossus</h2>
<p>
    Operating in Memphis, Tennessee; xAI’s supercomputer “Colossus” has become one of the biggest air polluters in Shelby County, primarily affecting the Boxtown neighborhood. According to the Southern Environmental Law Center; Colossus is being powered by 35 unpermitted methane gas turbines, enough to power an entire city. By releasing pollutants into the air that directly affects the lungs, like nitrogen dioxide, xAIs turbines are causing a public health crisis. Despite the backlash from residents of Shelby County, Elon Musk plans to double its size and has already bought property just a mile away from Colossus to expand xAI with the support of Memphis mayor, Paul Young.

<h2>Meta AI</h2>
<p>
    Mark Zuckerberg plans on building multiple data centers, one of them being the size of Manhattan, aiming to be the first to develop “superintelligence” and to bring a gigawatt-plus supercluster online. Hyperion, the data center that will be as big as Manhattan, will be built in Louisiana, will be up to 5 gigawatts over the next several years, and is expected to be fully online by 2030.
